# Roadmap

Phases:

1. Foundations (M0â€“M3)
   - ECS core, schedules, resources
   - Grid map, FOV, A* pathfinding

2. Colony core (M4â€“M8)
   - Workshops, stockpiles, zones, designations
   - Fluids (2D cellular), temperature basics
   - Needs, moods, traits, professions
   - Combat MVP, injuries, death
   - Procedural worldgen (biomes, civs), caravans

3. Depth and polish (M9+)
   - Z-levels, multi-layer fluids
   - Advanced AI (squads, sieges), diplomacy
   - Economy, artifacts, events, justice
   - Modding/API, content packs, scenario editor

Release trains:

- Nightly: bleeding edge
- Alpha: monthly tagged builds
- Beta: feature complete, stabilization

   - Operate station job and outputs
   - MVP stations and recipes wired
   - CLI demo: workshops ASCII summary
   - Integration tests: deterministic outputs
   - Save/Load support for stations/orders
   - UntilHave(N) and output hauling to stockpiles

4. **Zones** (#93 â†’ #113)
   - Core zone types, policies, and events
   - Zone indexer and occupancy counters
   - Acceptance API and deterministic selection
   - Reservation system with timeouts
   - Haul job generation (groundâ†’stockpile)
   - Give/Take links and A->B feeder logic
   - CLI demo (zones overlay)
   - Save/Load schemas + migration
   - Rebalancing (bounded work)
   - Docs polish and guidance

5. **Worldgen Epic** (#138 â†’ #146)
   - Core scaffolding (params, noise helpers, fixed-point, grids)
   - Heightmap generation + sea level classification
   - Temperature and rainfall layers
   - Flow direction, accumulation, and river classification
   - Depression filling and lake detection
   - Thermal erosion pass with frontier limiting
   - Biome assignment via table; palette and ASCII renderer

#### P2 (Medium Priority - M4)
6. **Needs/Moods/Traits** (#160)
   - Deterministic motivation model
   - Components: Needs, NeedRates, Thoughts, Mood, Traits
   - Systems: ComputeEffectiveNeedRates, ApplyNeedRates, etc.

   - Flow fields, JPS, 8-way movement
   - Dynamic costs from fluids and terrain
   - Many-to-one goals optimization

## Agent-Friendly Priority Queue

### How to Work
1. **Pick topmost P1 story** in your area
2. **Ensure determinism and tests** per acceptance criteria
3. **Link your PR** to the issue (Fixes #N) and the parent epic where relevant
4. **One PR per issue** - include tests and CLI demo updates if applicable
5. **Keep changes deterministic** (no wall-clock time dependencies)
6. **Update docs** if behavior changes

### Current Work Areas
- **Combat MVP**: Focus on P0 issues first (#128, #129, #130, #131, #133, #137)
- **Fluids M3**: P1 issues (#115-#124) - foundational for temperature and phase changes
- **Workshops M3**: P1 issues (#82-#91) - production chains and automation
- **Zones**: P1 issues (#93-#113) - logistics and stockpile management
- **Worldgen**: P1 issues (#138-#146) - procedural world generation

### Milestones and Epics
- **M3 scope**: labeled "milestone:m3" - current active milestone
- **Epics**: labeled "epic" (see #33, #34, #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #41, #42)
- **Z-levels Epic**: #39 - future M4+ feature for multi-layer worlds
