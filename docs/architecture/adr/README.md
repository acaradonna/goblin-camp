# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for Goblin Camp. These documents capture important architectural decisions and their context, rationale, and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows the standard format:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Consequences**: Expected positive and negative effects

## Current ADRs

- [ADR-0001: Time and Determinism Strategy](0001-time-determinism.md) - Establishes fixed-step scheduling and RNG management for deterministic simulation
