# World Generation

Targets:

- Overworld: heightmap + rainfall + temperature -> biomes
- Sites: embark map carved from world tiles

Approach:

- Noise-based terrain, rivers, lakes; erosion pass
- Place civs/roads; simulate histories for flavor (lightweight)
- Data-driven params for seeds and biome defs
